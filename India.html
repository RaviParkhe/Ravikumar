            India is a land of various cultures and a rich heritage. It is the seventh-largest country by area and the second-most populous country globally. The peacock is India’s national bird, and the Bengal tiger is the country’s national animal. The national song is named Vande Matram (written by Bankimchandra Chatterji). The Indian national song was first performed at the Indian National Congress in 1896. ‘Jana Gana Mana,’ India’s national anthem, is sung in 52 seconds. The national flag of India is named Tiranga, which is made up of three colours: saffron, white, and green, with the Ashoka Chakra in navy blue in the centre.

            India is a beautiful land with a variety of wildlife and rich cultural diversity. The Bengal Tiger is considered the national animal of India. India celebrates its Independence Day on 15th August every year. It is observed to commemorate the freedom of India from the British. The tri-coloured national flag is called Tiranga, designed with saffron, white and green with the Ashok Chakra in navy blue at the centre of the flag. ‘Lion Capital of Ashoka’ is the country’s national emblem. The national motto is ‘Satyameva Jayate,’ which means truth alone wins.
In order to run the country smoothly, and make it an independent country, there was a need for a constitution which came into force on 26th January 1950. We observe this day as Republic Day every year.
India is a land of many different languages and many different religions such as Buddhism, Jainism, Islam, Hinduism, etc. There are various food styles and dressing styles depending on the regions of the country, setting the perfect example of Unity in Diversity.
